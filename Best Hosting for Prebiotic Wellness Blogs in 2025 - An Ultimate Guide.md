A key advantage of SPanel is that it is included free with Scala Hosting's managed VPS plans, potentially saving you significant costs compared to providers that charge extra for cPanel.

With a managed VPS, Scala Hosting handles the server administration, including software updates, security patches, and performance optimization.
