### Security Features:
Scala Hosting prioritizes security with features such as free SSL certificates, daily backups, and proactive server monitoring. They also offer advanced security options like malware scanning and DDoS protection to safeguard websites from potential threats. SPanel also includes a built-in firewall and intrusion detection system to enhance security.

### Pricing:
Scala Hosting's pricing varies depending on the specific hosting plan and resources required. Their managed VPS hosting plans typically start at a higher price point compared to shared hosting, but offer greater performance, scalability, and control. They offer a 30-day money-back guarantee, allowing users to try their services risk-free. For example, the Start plan begins around $14.95/month (promotional pricing), offering sufficient resources for a starting research website.
